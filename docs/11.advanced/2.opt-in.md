title: 'Opt-In Hot Reload'
---

In some cases (i.e. when working on non-livewire elements), you'll want to full reload the page when a blade file is changed.

By adding an `VITE_LIVEWIRE_OPT_IN=true` entry in your `.env` file an opt-in checkbox will show on the bottom right corner of the webpage, allowing you to enable/disable livewire hot reload. If disabled: a full page reload will be triggered when blade files are changed.

If you're using a debug toolbar like [Debugbar for Laravel](https://github.com/barryvdh/laravel-debugbar), [Clockwork](https://underground.works/clockwork/) or [Laravel Telescope Toolbar](https://github.com/fruitcake/laravel-telescope-toolbar), these are taken into account, while positioning the checkbox. No special configuration is needed.
There may be another (debug) toolbar or something else in your view interfere with the checkbox. Therefore, a config option `bottomPosition` is available to add more spacing to the bottom, to make the checkbox visible again. The value must be of type number and is considered to be pixels.

```js
// vite.config.js 

import livewire, {defaultWatches} from '@defstudio/vite-livewire-plugin';

export default defineConfig({
    //...
    
    plugins: [
        //...
        
        livewire({
            bottomPosition: 34,
        }),
    ],
});
```
