You can install the package via npm:

``` bash
npm install --save-dev @defstudio/vite-livewire-plugin
```

## Set up

Livewire hot reload can be enabled by adding the `livewire()` plugin to the `vite.config.js` file:

```javascript
import {defineConfig} from 'vite';
import laravel from 'laravel-vite-plugin';

import livewire from '@defstudio/vite-livewire-plugin'; // <-- import

export default defineConfig({
    //...
    
    plugins: [
        laravel([
            input: [
                'resources/css/app.css',
                'resources/js/app.js',
            ],
            refresh: false, // <-- disables laravel autorefresh, to avoid conflicts
        ]),
        
        livewire({  // <-- add livewire plugin
            refresh: ['resources/css/app.css'],  // <-- will refresh css (tailwind ) as well
        }),
    ],
});
```

and add the livewire hot reload manager in your `app.js` file:

```js
//..

import {livewire_hot_reload} from 'virtual:livewire-hot-reload'

livewire_hot_reload();
```

After the Vite server is started, you should see the init message on your browser console:

```
[vite] connecting...
[vite] livewire hot reload ready.
[vite] connected.
```

From now on, when a `.blade.php` or Livewire `.php` class is updated, the hot reload will trigger a refresh for all Livewire components in page (and the app.css file as well):

```
[vite] css hot updated: /resources/css/app.css
[vite] livewire hot updated.
```

## Full refresh collisions

> **Warning**
> This Vite plugin, as Livewire needs to persist in page, is not fully compatible with other plugins that full refresh the page when a `.blade.php` file changes (i.e. laravel/vite-plugin with refresh option active)
> in order to make them work together, `blade` files in `**/livewire/**` should be excluded from blade hot reload. For Laravel Vite plugin, this config would solve the issue:

```js
// vite.config.js
export default defineConfig({
//...
    plugins: [
        //...
    
        laravel({
            // ...
            refresh: false,
        })
    ],
});
```
